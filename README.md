## Precision Phenotyping in Wheat: LiDAR-Based Plant Height and Lodging Estimation Using Unmanned Ground Vehicle
Accurate phenotyping of wheat traits is essential for advancing breeding programs and crop science research. This study employs the University of Saskatchewan Field Phenotyping Systems (UFPS), an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), across six Canadian research stations during the 2023 and 2024 field seasons to explore LiDAR-based evaluation of crop canopy height and lodging in spring wheat. A total of 90 plots of 30 historical wheat cultivars were planted in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD), with LiDAR data collected at key growth stages.

Four methods—height distribution vector, aerial projection, orthographic projection, and voxelized spatial grid—were assessed for canopy structure and lodging estimation. For canopy height, aerial projection (95.98%) and orthographic projection (96.05%) delivered the highest accuracy, with RMSE and MAPE at 3.7 cm and 3.55%. Voxelized spatial grid and height distribution vector methods showed lower performance, with R-squared values of 88.15% and 84.37%.

For lodging, aerial projection excelled, achieving up to 0.97 Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK), and 98.51% Macro-F1, especially in 2- and 3-class scenarios. The voxelized spatial grid performed competitively, while height distribution vector and orthographic projection exhibited scalability issues in higher class numbers. These results establish aerial projection as a robust method for high-throughput phenotyping in spring wheat.
